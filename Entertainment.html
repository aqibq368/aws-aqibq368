    <p><br><strong>The Blue Angels,’ filmed for IMAX, puts viewers in the ‘box’ with the elite flying squad
    </strong><br>If you’re looking for a little bit of that “ Top Gun: Maverick ” spectacle and thrill at the movie theater this summer, you’re in luck. A groundbreaking new documentary, “ The Blue Angels,” is flying onto IMAX screens for one week, through May 22.

    Using IMAX-certified cameras mounted on a helicopter, the filmmakers were granted unprecedented access to the U.S. Navy’s Flight Demonstration Squadron, both on the ground and in “the box,” the tightly guarded performance airspace. Unlike in a Hollywood movie, there were no staged recreations, second takes or computer-generated shots. And they had about “5% of the budget” “Top Gun” had, those involved estimated.
    
    <br><strong>The film was the brainchild of Rob Stone and Greg “Boss”</strong><br> Woolridge, a former Blue Angel and subject of a 1994 film about one of their historic tours in Europe. COVID-19 derailed plans to follow their 75th anniversary season, but a silver lining would emerge in the delay. By that point, aerial coordinator Kevin LaRosa II had worked several times with actor Glen Powell, on “Top Gun” and “Devotion.” Powell, he’d learned, had grown up with a Blue Angels lithograph in his childhood bedroom. 
    Soon, they were also talking to J.J. Abrams’ company Bad Robot and figuring out ways to collaborate with IMAX and show audiences things that no civilian has seen before, under the direction of filmmaker Paul Crowder.

Abrams, who also produced, had grown up living across the street from a former Blue Angel pilot and wrote in an email that he’d “always been intrigued by their skill, bravery and heroism.” This film would take that fascination to the next level.

“The footage was filmed especially for IMAX,” Abrams continued. “Watching these pilots do their thing in this format — the jets literally inches apart — is utterly bonkers. Truly spectacular to see.”
