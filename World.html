    <p><br><strong>Mexico’s cartel violence haunts civilians as the June 2 election approaches</strong><br>HUITZILAC, Mexico (AP) — Tailed by trucks of heavily armed soldiers, four caskets floated on a sea of hundreds of mourners. Neighbors peered nervously from their homes as the crowd pushed past shuttered businesses, empty streets and political campaign posters plastering the small Mexican town of Huitzilac.

        Days earlier, armed men in two cars sprayed a nearby shop with bullets, claiming the lives of eight men who locals say were sipping beers after a soccer match. Now, fear paints the day-to-day lives of residents who say the town is trapped unwillingly in the middle of a firefight between warring mafias.
        
        <br><strong>As Mexico’s expanding slate of criminal groups</strong><br> see the June 2 election as an opportunity to seize power, they have picked off more than 100 people in politically-motivated killings, including about 20 candidates this year, and warred for turf, terrorizing local communities like Huitzilac.
        For years, it’s been at the center of a tug-of-war between a rotating set of cartels and gangs, making headlines in 2012 when police inexplicably pumped a U.S. Embassy vehicle with 152 bullets. When Anahi’s car, her only means of work, was stolen from her garage last year, she said she didn’t dare report it because “they might do something to me.”

        <br>But Anahi said she’s never been as scared as she has been since local and presidential elections began to heat up in October.
        
        “We’re going to ask at the school meeting that they do classes remotely until the elections are over so our kids aren’t in danger,” she said. “What would happen if there’s a shootout and our kids are there?”
